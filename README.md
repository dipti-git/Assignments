Our planet has been attacked by a new virus COVID-19 and everyone is practicing "Shelter in place" (Please stay in your houses guys). The Government is offering a free MOMO service to peeps who are experiencing financial hardship. But to qualify for the program you have to meet some requirements.

Requirements to qualify:

If the person's salary is less than 30,000 or savings is less than 4000. The person qualifies for free MOMO.
Childern, Students, Pregnant women and a elderlies qualify for free MOMO.
Rest do not qualify for this program. Give them a Virtual hug.
Everyone who qualifies gets one plate MOMO except for the following people:

People from Dharan get Life time free momo, and high-five from one of the tutors ;)
If you love 3 idiots and have watched it more than 10 times give 10 plate momos.
If you are a magician. Let the program pick a random number between 1 to 10 and give that many amount of momos. (HINT: random.randint)
Additional requirements from the tutor: Be inclusive
